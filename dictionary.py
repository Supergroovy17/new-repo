#Task 1: Customer Service Ticket Tracker Demonstrate your ability to use nested collections and loops by creating a system to track customer service tickets.

#Problem Statement: Develop a program a function that:

#Tracks customer service tickets, each with a unique ID, customer name, issue description, and status (open/closed).
#Implement functions to:
#Open a new service ticket.
#Update the status of an existing ticket.
#Display all tickets or filter by status.
#Initialize with some sample tickets and include functionality for additional ticket entry.
#Example ticket structure:

service_tickets = {
    "Ticket001": {"Customer": "Alice", "Issue": "Login problem", "Status": "open"},
    "Ticket002": {"Customer": "Bob", "Issue": "Payment issue", "Status": "closed"}
}


#def new_service ():
   #.update


#def update_status():

#.update
#def show_tickets():
    #print(service_tickets)

#def show_status():
    #print(Status)
